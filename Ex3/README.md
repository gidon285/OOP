# :mortar_board: Weighted Directed Graph Python Implementation

An implementation of a Weighted Directed graph in Python  
This project in implemented in three different files:  
  
- **DiGraph** - an object representing a graph tha points to all of its containing nodes  
- **NodeData** - an object representing each individual node/vertex in the graph, Each and every vertex hold the information about he's neighbors and edges 
- **GraphAlgo** - an object that implements some basic graph algorithms
- **Comparisons** - a combination of functions that run our project (+ Former Java Ex2) vs. Networkx and compares running time

## Time Comparisons (Part 3)

![alt text](resources/myplot.png)

In **Comparisons** we run 6 different graphs from the `data/Graphs_on_circle` folder and compare the running time between on three different projects:
- `Networkx`: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html
- Our former `Ex2 Java` project: https://github.com/ShmuelLa/OOP_ex2
- This repositor 
Because the running time on the small graphs in too small we compared the projects on the biggest graph - `G_30000_240000`

> all the tests were run on an intel i7-8565U with 16GB of ram

## Main Algorithms Used

### Strongly Connected Components:
![alt text](resources/scc.png)
An SCC is a component in a graph that contains noded which can reach each other form any direction.
For our SCC algorithm we used a former BFS we used in the previous exam which runs from a node to all of it's neighbors, transposes the graph and checks the directions again.
This time we added a feature to the result of that algorithm that will return the intersection of the two paths the BFS went through.
Than we wrote another function which calss the BFS algorithm for each and every "unvisited"  node (Means that the node itself still doesn't have an SCC).   
> Note: at firsts we implemented and used Tarjan's algorithm with recursive DFS but because of the big graphs we needed to run we reached max recursion depth and after increasing it we reached a Stack Overflow error. so we used a more "simple" algorithm

### Dijkstra Algorithm:
A searching algorithm. in this version of Dijkstra we use a Priority que, that is because we are "traveling" across a Weighted
graph. by using a Priority que(heapq) we can pull the lowest weighted node out with each iteration.
we start by marking our current node as visited (use the node info -"y"), then we travel trough the graph in using BFS algorithm.
each node we come across we first mark the distance as ("inf")-positive infinity, then we calculate the actual distance
and if it's lower than ("inf") we set the nodes weight to that value. next we make a dict of all parents and children.
when all the nodes are visited we backtrack across the parent dict, adding  each node to a list
then return it. with the destination node weight. finally, we reset the graph - marking each node's tag to 0 and each info to "".  
  
## :computer: Main Classes and Methods  
  
### :chart_with_upwards_trend: DiGraph
This class implements a mathematical weighted graph by implements two classes internally
 :one: **NodeInfo** which implements the basic information and methods each node stores
 :two: **EdgeInfo** which stores all the data and methods for all the edges in the graph. This internal class 
 is implemented on top of the received interface's for higher efficiency and complexity of the project.
 Each graph consists of two HashMap data structures. One for the node and the other for the edges.
 Each graph also has an integer that count the edges and the mode count (internal changes count) of the graph

## :mag: Tests

With TestDiGraph we made a couple of scenarios, we tested to all of our methods and algorithms.
Including Dijkstra, BFS. We ran run time tests, with our previous project in Java, and Networkx.
