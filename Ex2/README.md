# :mortar_board: Pokemon Game on Directed Weighted Graph Java Implementation

This project is divided into to main components:
- An implementation of a directed weighted graph which is being used to participate in a Pokemon catching game.
- The second and main component of this project is the Pokemon catching game. In this game we developed algorithmic artificial intelligence that scans the graph and catches as much pokemons as it cans
  
### Project structure
The projects structure includes two main packages:
- **API** - The main directed weighted graph classes and sources
- **Game Client** - The main game component contains all the algorithms and objects for playing the game
    - **Util** - Utilities for the whole projects most of them are use for painting and claulating
    
   
- Our main data structure of choice is a **HashMap** that is used to store every node in the graph and also used to 
implement weighted graph main mechanism, the weighted edges via the **EdgeInfo** object. 
  
- The main reasons we chose HashMap is because of the high efficiency for our project.  
For example the efficient `put()`, `get()` and `contains()` are all O(1) and most importantly the `values()` and `keyset()` methods that  
returns a **Collection** view of all the values/keys contained in this map accordingly. The `values()` and `keyset()` are perfect for the implementation  
of our `getV()` methods which are used in almost every algorithm and iteration in this project.  
  
## :computer: Main Classes and Methods  
  
### :chart_with_upwards_trend: DWGraph_DS

This class implements a mathematical directed weighted graph by implements two classes internally
 :one: **NodeData** which implements the basic information and methods each node stores
 :two: **EdgeDB** which stores all the data and methods for all the edges in the graph. This internal class 
 is implemented on top of the received interface's for higher efficiency and complexity of the project.
 Each graph consists of two HashMap data structures. One for the node and the other for the edges.
 Each graph also has an integer that count the edges and the mode count (internal changes count) of the graph

## :mag: Tests

In this project we invested extensively in testing our implementation. 
We created a test for each and every complex and simple method in this project.

The tests rely on two main mechanisms:
- a `graph_creator()` method we build that creates a graph with the set amount 
of nodes and edges while randomizing their connections
- a complex and unique graph build in advanced that we researched it behavior and take advantage 
of that in order to test complex algorithms like BFS and Dijkstra's. 
Implemented in `mainTestGraph()` and `mainTestGraphAlg()` accordingly
